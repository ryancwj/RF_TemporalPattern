Timeseries clustering for rainfall distribution patterns

Rainfall timeseries data often shows a consistent distribution pattern or more commonly known as temporal patterns in hydrology.
Rainfall temporal pattern (RTP) is considered to be one of the most critical variables in design flood estimation.
Conventional methods usually assumes the peak rainfall occurs in the halfway point of the time considered.
While conservative, the traditional methods do not take into consideration of multiple storm peaks which may result in over- or underestimating rainfall volumes.
Unrealistic storm timings give rise to inaccurate water level estimations in hydraulic models, leading to unrealistic design specifications for flood mitigation or construction purposes.

Timeseries clustering proves to be a feasible method in determining these storm patterns.
